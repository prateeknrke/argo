                        change in occupancy of an existing development as inappropriate or unwanted for their local
                        area. The opposition to affordable, supportive, or transitional housing is usually based on the
                        assumed characteristics of the population that will be living in the development. Common
                        arguments are that there will be increases in crime, litter, thefts, violence, and that property
                        taxes will decrease. The benefits for the residents of the development are often ignored” <a
